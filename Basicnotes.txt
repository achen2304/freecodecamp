empty callback function: () => {}; 
    fallback value: (var = ""): for writing algorithms that won't immediately have a return value

implicit returns: (param) => condition;
ternary operator: const example = 
    condition ? "I'm true" : "I'm false"
optional chaining: Object?.value, When an object's value 
    can equal to null or undefined, use this so it returns 
    undefined or null instead of throwing error
===: first checks if both vars are same types, then equality
==: converts both var types to something common, then checks equality 

dot(.) notation: object.val1 - returns the value1 of object 
destructuring syntax: const { val1, val2 } = object;
    sets val1 & val2 to the object's val1 & val2
